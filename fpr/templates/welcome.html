<p>The FPR lists all of Archivematica's default format policy rules. In your Archivematica 1.0 instance you can download updates from the FPR as well as replace default rules with your own local policies. Upcoming FPR enhancements will include statistical information about the default and custom format policies implemented by Archivematica users. See archivematica.org for more information.</p>
